Hello, this is my first ever project (Html & Scss/css) in developing field, so we've got some bugs,
hard-coding, code is messy and looks like hell and ect...
But I will improve.

Natours is a web-page about tours around the world, for adventurous people.

P.s 
1) SCSS file pathes are not customised for github pages
2) Page is made responsive for all screens and works for every browser, except Safari
